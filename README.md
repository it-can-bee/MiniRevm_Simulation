# A Tool for EVM Emulatiton by Rust

The EVM Rust Emulator is a simple in-memory Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) emulator written in Rust. It is designed to be a lightweight and easy-to-use tool for developers who want to test EVM bytecode execution directly in a command line or in a Rust crate, without using a full EVM node with his RPC to interact with a blockchain.

üöß **Notice** üöß

This project is currently experimental and subject to frequent changes as we are still working on stabilizing EVM emulation. It has not been audited for security purposes and should not be used in production yet.

## Upcoming features (Contributions welcome ‚ù§Ô∏è)

- EVM gas usage
- EVM concurrent exec
- EVM instructor concurrent exec

## Contributions

To contribute to the EVM Rust Emulator, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. 


```curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh```

If you need any tools or packages, you can consider the homebrew(macOS), it is powerful! Such as
